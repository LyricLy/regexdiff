    <h1>about</h1>
    <p>regexdiff is a tool that analyzes regular expressions. you can use it to figure out what a regex does, or why one that you wrote isn't working right.
    the way it works is simple: you put in a regex and a string, and it tells you the closest string to the one you gave that matches the instruction.</p>
    <p>for example, if you've written a URL regex <code>https://\w+\.\w+</code> and it isn't matching the right strings, you could put <code>http://google.com</code> in
    and regexdiff will tell you that it needs an <code>s</code> to match -- sounds like you forgot a <code>?</code>! it will also tell you that <code>https://www.example.com</code>
    doesn't match because it has too many dotted sections.</p>
    <p>this tool works with the mathematical kind of regexes. it does not care about capturing groups and it will not "search" the string for a match. either the whole string matches, or none of it does.
    if you want to match strings that <em>contain</em> an expression, just put <code>.*</code> to either side of it.</p>
    <p>backreferences and recursion are not supported, but lookahead and lookbehind (both positive and negative) are. however, due to the behaviour
    mentioned above, your regex will not be able to match anything if you put a lookahead at the end of it. instead of <code>followed by foo: (?=foo)</code>,
    just write <code>followed by foo: foo</code>. (capturing isn't a thing here!)</p>
    <h1>troubleshooting</h1>
    <p>if the tool complains that your regex "cannot match any strings", it means that its structure is contradictory in such a way that there is no string that matches it.
    the most common way this will happen is misusing lookaround, like by doing <code>(?=a)b</code>.</p>
    <p>remember that regexdiff expects the expression to match the whole string
    exactly, including where it starts and ends. the expression <code>a</code> doesn't match the string <code>ab</code>. for that reason, it always creates
    an impossible expression if you have a lookahead at the end of the expression or a lookbehind at its beginning, because you cannot simultaneously be at the end of the
    match <em>and</em> still have characters remaining.</p>
    <p>if your pattern doesn't involve lookaround (and doesn't contain the empty character class <code>[]</code>) then this error is very likely to be a bug. please report
    it to me on <a href="https://github.com/LyricLy/regexdiff">GitHub</a>.</p>
